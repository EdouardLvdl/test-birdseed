## Where I spend most of my time 🪐

<br/>

- [Stakin](https://stakin.com) provides staking-as-service for Proof-of-Stake blockchains. The company operates a highly secure infrastructure in order to validate blocks on leading PoS networks. This enables delegators to earn rewards on their holdings, and take part in decentralized governance. Staking services are offered for more than 20 networks, including Polygon, Cosmos, Icon, Solana, Near, Polkadot, Skale, Tezos, Terra Money, Regen, Mina and more. The company boasts 5,000+ delegators and \$750m+ assets under delegation. More recently, Stakin has started developing decentralized finance applications, such as the first staking lossless lottery available at [lottery.stakin.com](https://lottery.stakin.com), running on the ICON blockchain. Another project in the works is [Stakin Finance](https://finance.stakin.com), an Automated Market Maker and Yield Farming platform.
